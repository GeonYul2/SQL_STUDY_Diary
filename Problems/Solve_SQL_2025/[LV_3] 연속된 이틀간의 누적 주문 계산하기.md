## SQL Solution

```sql

    WHEN weekday(purchased_at) = 2 THEN 'Wednesday'
    WHEN weekday(purchased_at) = 3 THEN 'Thursday'
    WHEN weekday(purchased_at) = 4 THEN 'Friday'
    WHEN weekday(purchased_at) = 5 THEN 'Saturday'
    ELSE 'Sunday'

LEFT join base b2 on b1.order_date = date_add(b2.order_date,INTERVAL 1 day)
